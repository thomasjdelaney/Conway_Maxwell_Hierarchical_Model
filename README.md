A repository for the code of a statistical model of mouse brain activity based on the Conway-Maxwell-Binomial distribution.

### Data

The data used is available online from Nick Steinmetz's lab. You can find it [here](http://data.cortexlab.net/dualPhase3/).

### Conway-Maxwell-binomial distribution

We wrote a repository specifically for creating and fitting Conway-Maxwell-binomial distributions. You can find it [here](https://github.com/thomasjdelaney/Conway_Maxwell_Binomial_Distribution).

##### TODO
- Change the x-axis on figures so that the stimulus onset is at 0s.
